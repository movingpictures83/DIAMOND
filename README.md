PluMA plugin to perform protein alignments with DIAMOND (Buchfink et al, 2014).

The plugin will take as input a TXT file of keyword-value pairs (whitespace-delimited):
database: Protein database file (FASTA)
sequences: DNA sequences to align (FASTA)

The alignment will then be output in FASTA format as well.

This plugin has been generated by PluGen, and relies on DIAMOND being in the system PATH.
